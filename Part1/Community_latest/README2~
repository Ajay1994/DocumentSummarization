1. We are using the Lovian Clustering Method for clustering the graphs
2. In the Graphs folder : we have the graph prepared for entired DUC01 dataset.
3. First "make" the Lovian file using "make".
4. Compile "lovianclustering.c" by using "gcc lovianclustering.c"
5. Run the produced executable by "./a.out"
6. This will generate all the clusters on the individual DUC01 data file and save it to clusteredGraph directory.
