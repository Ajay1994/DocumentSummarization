A commission chaired by Sir Richard Southwood a professor at Oxford University reported last year that the cause of BSE is quite unlike any bacteria or known viruses.
The incurable disease eats holes in the brains of its victims in late stages a sick animal may act skittish or stagger drunkenly.

Department of Agricultures Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in July banned imports of cattle embryos and bull semen from Britain said Margaret Webb a USDA spokeswoman in Washington.
Similar embargoes have been imposed by Australia Finland Israel Sweden West Germany and New Zealand according to the Agriculture Ministry and the European Community has proposed a ban on exports of British cattle older than 6 months.
