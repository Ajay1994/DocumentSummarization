 The focus of the drought plaguing much of the nation has shifted eastward but little relief is in sight for most areas the National Weather Service reported Thursday.
Rapidly moving weather systems are expected to drag weak fronts along the U.S.Canadian border possibly triggering scattered showers in the extreme northern Plains and upper Mississippi Valley.
And a separate climate assessment added that many areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months.
On Tuesday the Agriculture Department announced sharp reductions in the anticipated harvest of many crops because of the water shortage  and those projections were based on the assumption of normal weather from here on according to department officials.
The national picture shows the current drought to be about equivalent to that of 1911 and still somewhat less severe than in several years in the 1930s or 1956.
In addition to Thursdays shortrange forecast the mediumrange outlook through July 23 anticipates much of the nation will remain hotter than normal particularly the Tennessee Valley lower Midwest central and northern Great Plains northern Rockies and Great Basin.
