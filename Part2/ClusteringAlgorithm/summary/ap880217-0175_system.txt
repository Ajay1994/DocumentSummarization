That approach was upheld by a federal court in a similar suit brought by the same immigration reform group before the 1980 Census.
 A coalition of members of Congress announced Wednesday that they plan to sue the Census Bureau in an effort to force the agency to delete illegal aliens from its count in 1990.
The group contends that including the estimated 2 million or more illegal aliens in the national head count which is used to distribute seats in the House of Representatives will cause unfair shifts of seats from one state to another.
Constitution which does not mention citizenship but only instructs that the House apportionment be based on the whole number of persons residing in the various states.
Nonetheless Dan Stein of the immigration reform federation contended that illegal aliens should not be allowed to be part of determining the political structure of the United States.
Tom Ridge RPa. said the Census Bureau should actually count everyone but that it should develop a method to determine how many people are illegally in the country and them deduct that number from the figures used for reapportioning Congress.
