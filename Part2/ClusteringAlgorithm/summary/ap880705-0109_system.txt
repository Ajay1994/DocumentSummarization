U.S.
In southern Utahs scenic Zion National Park firefighters tried today to contain a 600acre fire that was ignited by lightning June 19 but had been allowed to burn in a small area.
The fire which began Saturday was declared contained this morning We have evidence confirming that it was a bottle rocket said Mary Hale a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry.
However on Sunday winds ranging from 30 mph to 60 mph fanned the flames out of control Chief Ranger Bob Andrew said.
A fourday fire in 1100 acres of Hiawatha National Park in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan was also said to be under control although continued hot dry weather could mean weeks before the fire is extinguished.
Cooler temperatures and calmer wind played a role in getting the blaze contained on the west riverbank which is about two miles from the trail Jaquith said.
