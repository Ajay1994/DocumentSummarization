Category 5 storms have winds greater than 155 mph barometric pressure of less than 27.17 inches and a storm surge higher than 18 feet.
The previous record low pressure of 26.35 inches was set by the 1935 Labor Day hurricane that struck the Florida Keys with winds above 150 mph killing 408 people he said.
Hurricane Debby which barely crossed the 74 mph threshold to hurricane strength before striking Mexico last month was probably about half that size Moore said.
The others were the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille which bulldozed the Mississippi Coast with 172 mph winds and a 28foot wave in 1969 leaving 1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead.
The storm surge  a great dome of water that follows the eye of the hurricane across coastlines bulldozing everything in its path  accounts for nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities.
The damage from these worstcase hurricanes is catastrophic  shrubs and trees blown down all street signs gone roofs and windows blown away and shattered and mobile homes destroyed.
