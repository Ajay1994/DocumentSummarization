Dealing with a major hurricane isnt much different from dealing with smaller ones or tropical storms Sheets said adding that Gilbert has been particularly wellbehaved.
And interest in Gilbert has been high since it started packing hurricaneforce winds over the weekend and by Tuesday afternoon became a Category 5 storm with winds of 160 mph and a central pressure of 26.66 inches.
Sheets who was acting director during the 1987 Atlantic hurricane season and was named director in March spent most of the morning on the sixth floor of hurricane headquarters beside a large monitor showing the destructive Hurricane Gilbert sprawled across much of the western Caribbean.
The transition from former Director Neil Frank widely known for his distinctive style and flattop haircut to Sheets his dark blond hair carefully coiffed and wearing a bright pink shirt with a gray woolblend jacket has been a smooth one.
The centers 33member crew including seven hurricane forecasters and specialists are keeping a close watch of the hurricane in a large open room of blue monitors flickering with color and noncolor graphics.
And while Sheets might appear to be spend most of his day with tiny microphones snaking down his back for TV interviews and fielding questions he also writes most of the hurricane advisories issued every three hours and makes hurricane forecasts.
