Arafat the Palestine Liberation Organization leader claimed the threat to kill PLO officials was made in a U.S. government document the PLO obtained from an Arab government.
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the United States has been in touch with a number of Middle Eastern countries about possible PLO attacks against American citizens and facilities.
The State Department said in Washington that it had received reports the PLO might target Americans because of alleged U.S. involvement in the assassination of Khalil Wazir the PLOs second in command.
Arafat spoke at a news conference in his heavily guarded villa in Baghdad where extra security guards have been deployed.
It has come to our attention that the PLO leader Yasser Arafat may have personally approved a series of terrorist attacks against American citizens and facilities abroad possibly in retaliation for last months assassination of Abu Jihad.
Arafat said the document reveals the U.S. administration is planning in full cooperation with the Israelis to conduct a crusade of terrorist attacks and then to blame the PLO for them.
