It is also anticipated that the average hurricane which does form in 1988 will likely be more intense than have the average hurricanes of the last six years except for the 1985 season Gray said in a paper presented to the conference.
 A hurricane expert predicts a turbulent summer in the Atlantic Ocean with more and fiercer storms swirling the seas but says its impossible to know if any of the storms will threaten populated areas.
William Gray a professor of atmospheric science at Colorado State University said Friday he expects about six Atlantic hurricanes this year the average for the last 40 years but above average for the decade.
Gray who has used wind and air pressure patterns to make annual hurricane forecasts each year since 1984 will issue his first formal 1988 forecast in late May.
But Gray said his models of air pressure winds around the equator and winds for El Nino periods when eastern Pacific waters are warmer than usual do not allow for predictions of when or where a hurricane might form.
Forecasters and emergency management officials at the conference stressed that coastal populations have increased rapidly during the lull in hurricanes a surge in storms up to the levels of the 1950s and 1960s could bring unprecedented damage they said.
