 Thousands of peole prayed cheered danced beat drums and observed other traditions today as a total eclipse of the sun darkened a wide area of Indonesia and the southern Philippines.
A partial eclipse was visible across a wide area of Asia as far west as India  including Southeast Asia China Japan and New Guinea as well as parts of Australia and the Pacific islands.
The sun was blacked out by the shadow of the moon for up to four minutes along a 108mile swath that moved from the Indian Ocean across Indonesia and the southern Philippine island of Mindanao.
In Kurukshetra India an estimated 1 million pilgrims dipped into the waters of the sacred Sannihit and Brahmsarover tanks after a public address system announced the start of the eclipse.
In Baguio City 130 miles north of Manila pregnant women of the local Ilocano community rinsed their hair during the eclipse with water dripped from burned rice straws in a traditional ritual.
Officials said about 20000 tourists and scientists from around the world had come to the southern Philippines to watch the eclipse the last one expected here for at least 50 years.
